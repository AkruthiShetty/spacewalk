  # Apply this task to EV1 only. Tasks should specify number of crew. If:

  # Optionally explicitly declare who is performing task. Not required since
  # default is both EV1 and EV2 in that order. May be required if we did a 3+
  # crew EVA (but we haven't done that in the past, nor do we currently plan to
  # do so). Also can be used to explicitly define who's doing what,
  # particularly if the order may swap back-and-forth during development

  # Grab a task-list (list of tasks out there that can be performed) but swap

    # need to put into them. For example, pretty much every ingress EV1 and EV2
    # are carrying some bag with them that they need to stow in the Airlock
    # first. We could pass variables to this task to add these details.
