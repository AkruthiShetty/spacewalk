2. Install Visual Studio Code
3. `git clone https://github.com/jamesmontalvo3/spacewalk.git` (or use one of the [forks](https://github.com/jamesmontalvo3/spacewalk/network/members) which be further ahead in development)
4. In visual studio code, open folder to view source code and other documentation in the repo.
5. After project is opened in VS Code, in the console, run `npm install`. This will install the `js-yaml` dependancy that is required to quickly parse the yaml files.
